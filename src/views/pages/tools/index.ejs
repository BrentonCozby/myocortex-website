                    <p>ISOPHIT is an innovative and carefully researched exercise system that works more than 650 muscles quickly. ISOPHIT harnesses the scientifically proven benefits of Isometric strength training in a way that’s never been done before. Isometric
                        exercise is certainly not new, but it is most definitely new again!</p>
                    <p>After years of limited results and cumulative injury with dynamic movement based exercise, exercise physiologists, personal trainers and a host of academic and medical journals are reawakening interest in isometric exercise as not only
                        the safest, but the most effective form of exercise available.</p>
                    <p>Whether your goal is to build strength, burn fat, improve bone density, lower blood pressure, decrease muscle and joint pain, correct muscle imbalances or enhance athletic performance, IT ALL STARTS HERE. </p>

                    <p>The “Pilates Method” of controlled movements, which look and feel like a workout not a therapy when properly manifested. If practiced with consistency, Contrology improves flexibility, builds strength and develops control and endurance
                        in the entire body.</p>
                    <p>The “Pilates Method” puts emphasis on alignment, breathing, developing a strong core, improving coordination and balance. The core, consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips is thought to be the key to a person's stability
                        while creating mobility.</p>
                    <p>This system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginner to advanced level specific to goals and/or limitations. Intensity can be increased over time as the body conditions and adapts to the process.</p>

                    <p>Weight Training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of the musculoskeletal system.</p>
                    <p>Strength Training utilizes the force of gravity with weighted bars, dumbbells, weight stacks and bands in order to oppose the force generated by muscle contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific
                        muscle groups devoted toward increasing physical strength.</p>
                    <p>The basic principles involve a manipulation of the number of reps, sets, tempo, exercise types, and weights moved to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size. The specific combinations depends on the the individual performing
                        the exercise.</p>
